document-analyser-in-C
======================

Still a work in progress..at the moment this program simply counts the number of words in a text document and outputs the results in non-decreasing order on a .csv file.....to run it, you have to supply the text document as the first argument of the command and the name you would like to call the .csv file as the second argument.

TODO:
	-improve efficiency by sorting the linked list before outputting to csv
	-provide default name for csv files and allow option of user not providing the name
	-add a graphical user interface for the program
